<title>BII Unloader Package</title>
</head>
<body>
This is the BII unloader package, used for building the Study unloader in the Import Layer package. 

This is the chain of dependencies involved for unloading one study: <br/>

<pre>
study
  upper levels (annotatable):
    annotations
      annotation types -> free-text
        ontology entries
          ref-source 
  publications
    upper levels (referrer):
      xrefs
        ref-source
      annotations -> see above
    status -> oe -> see above
  contacts
    roles -> oe -> see above
  assay results
    property-values
      type -> free text -> see above
      unit
        upper levels (free text) -> see above
        type -> free text -> see above
      (characteristic case has material, which is currently not used)
    data
      type -> oe -> see above
  assays
    upper levels (referrer):
      xrefs -> see above
	    annotations -> see above
    tech, endpoint -> oe -> see above
  designs -> free text -> see above
  protocols
    type -> oe -> see above
    params -> free text -> see above
    components -> free text -> see above
  investigations
    publication -> see above
    contacts -> see above
</pre>

<p>
These are the dependencies considered before unloading objects, i.e.: an object (that is usually reusable) cannot
be deleted if there are still instances of its dependants.  

<pre>
ref-source
  oe
  xrefs
  AssayTypeDataLoc
  
oe
  free-text
  
PubStatus
  StudyPub TODO: we have onetoone in the code, which is wrong
  InvPub
  
ContactRole
  StudyContact
  InvConctact 

ProtocolType
  Protocol

DataType
  Data
  TODO: in future we will have Material->Type too

Study
  Investigation (and vice-versa)

Property
  PropertyValue

Unit
  UnitValue but currently we don't reuse units
   
UnitValue
  PropertyValue, but currently we don't reuse units   
   
PropertyValue 
  assayResult.cascadedPropertyValues
  Same happens for material, protocolapp, but we don't save these yet
  
endpoint, tech
  assay
