/**
 * The name of the Factors used in the Study and/or Assays files. Factors should correspond to the independent variable
 * manipulated by experimentalists and intended to affect biological systems in such a way that an assay is devised to
 * measure the responses of the biological system to the perturbation by following a response variable (also known as
 * dependent variable).
 *
 * TODO: We currently *don't* have Characteristics or Parameters that are factors too. The model was initially designed
 * to support such a use case, but we don't need that for the moment.
