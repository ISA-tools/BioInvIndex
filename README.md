## Installation

**Build dependencies:**
    These are all managed by Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>. You'll just need to install it and then let maven handle everything else 

**Get the source:**

    git clone https://github.com/ISA-tools/BioInvIndex.git
    cd BioInvIndex/
    mvn clean package -Pdeploy,<<your_database_profile>>,<<your_index_profile>> -Dmaven.test.skip=true

The profiles.xml file contains example database connection profiles for H2, Oracle, MySQL and PostGreSQL. If you have no database yet, you can use H2 by running this command for instance:

    mvn clean package -Pdeploy,h2,index_local -Dmaven.test.skip=true
